# City Weather App

## Description

This project is a simple weather app that lets you look at the current weather for any city and the next five days as well. The idea of this application is that it can make it easier to plan trips to other cities by being able to checkout out the weather first. The app can also can be used to check your local city as well. Another reason I made this app was for practice making a server that interacts with other api's and a client server. I highly recommend others try to make a similar project if they are interested in trying to practice coding with api's and http request.
